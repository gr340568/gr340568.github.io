        what made it so popular? Its rich flavour? Or its amount of meat? The answer is that... it all starts at the
        peer
        influence. Lobster didn't become famous because its taste,
        but because of the influence that people gave after eating it. The railroad company had served this crustacean
        to
        inland people because they have not
        witnessed this exotic meal, those who were not aware of this ate it, and enjoyed the flavour. The chef realized
        that
        it look more appetizing and tasted
        better, and started to serve lobsters in 1880s, as a side dish just like bread and butter pickles in in the
        1850s
        and '60s. As the population of lobster decreased,
        the price had risen up, making it high priced. But still in great depression, poor families in maine sneaked at
        night and caught lobsters,
        showing how it still had its reputation as a food for the poor. but during ww2, people started to eat more
        lobster,
        and their value increased.
        By 1950s, they were seen as foods that rich people had served to their friends, or what movie stars ate during
        dinner, and this reputation still lasts till this day
        Not all people love them however, as they were still seen as the cockroaches of the sea.
