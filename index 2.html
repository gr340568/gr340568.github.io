    The history of the lobster had started as far as 1622, 
    when the quantities of the lobsters were abundant, and were easily affordable.
    These lobsters were found on the beach by the Massachusetts bay colony.
    At first glance people thought of it as a trash food.
    They were fit for the poor, and were only served to servants or prisoners

        The governor of the Plymouth Plantation, William Bradford was "embarassed to admit"
        that their only presented food was just a lobster, and just lobster itself only.
        In 1876, John Rowan wrote: "Lobster shells about a house are looked upon as sign of poverty and degradation."
        This shows how much lobster had been a symbol of poverty, and how it was a disgrace to present people with lobsters.
        They were mainly perceived as unfamiliar bottom feeding dwellers that resembles insects, as the name had came from an old English "Loppe"
        which refers to insects. People avoided eating lobsters in public, but they did eat it. and these lobsters were usually canned, (like spam or tuna)
        and costed 11 cent. This had costed less than the baked bean, which was 53 cent in 1940s.
